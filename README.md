# Bright Universe

> Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times, when one only remembers to turn on the light.

## Features

Enhance players' surroundings, without changing the day/night cycle of planets and their power production stats.

Settings & presets for each planet to brighten its rendering mode (only as a visual effect):
  - *Default*: as is
  - *Bright*: replaces few of the darkest transitions (night/sunset/dawn) with brighter parts of the day (noon/day)
  - *Nauvis*: uses same day/night/sunset/dawn color mask from Nauvis
  - *Always Day*: always render as day. Only visual effect, does not affect the day/night cycle and the power production of solar.
